## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer.git
cd file-organizer
```

### (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

No additional dependencies are required.

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
 uv run python file_organizer_v2.py
```

### Steps

1. Select a directory (defaults to **Downloads**)
2. Configure options:
   - Create missing folders
   - Include hidden files
   - Enable dry‑run mode
3. Click **Organize Files**
4. Monitor progress in the log window
5. Review your newly organized directory

---

## 🔐 Safety Notes

- Always back up important data before organizing files
- Use **dry‑run mode** before committing changes
- Files are **moved**, not copied
- Unknown extensions are placed into an `others` folder

---

## ⚙️ Customization

Modify file categories by editing the `folders` dictionary:

```python
folders = {
    "images": ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "bmp", "tiff", "webp"],
    "documents": ["txt", "pdf", "doc", "docx", "xls", "xlsx", "ppt", "pptx"],
    # Add more categories here...
}
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

## 📦 Bundle with PyInstaller

Install PyInstaller in your virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install pyinstaller
```

Create a single-file desktop executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --windowed --onefile --name FileOrganizer file_organizer_v2.py
```

Windows shortcut (uses local venv by default):

```powershell
.\build_windows.ps1
```

Output location:

- Windows: `dist/FileOrganizer.exe`
- macOS/Linux: `dist/FileOrganizer`

Notes:

- Keep running from the same executable path so app settings stay in your user config folder.
- Build artifacts are written to `build/` and `dist/`.

### Tkinter Not Installed (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Permission Errors

- Ensure write permissions to the target directory
- Run as administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/macOS)

### Files Not Moving

- Check if files are in use
- Ensure destination folders are writable
- Review error messages in the log window
